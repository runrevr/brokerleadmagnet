# Transaction Intelligence Assessment - Scoring System

## Strategic Scoring Philosophy

**Goal:** Show brokerages where they fall short compared to industry leaders (who use AI), creating clear value proposition for your system.

**Scoring Strategy:**
- AI-powered answers = 100 points (Industry Leader level)
- Manual/traditional methods = Low scores (showing the gap)
- Each category scores 0-100
- Final score = Average of 5 main categories
