Transaction Failure Risk Assessment
Revised Question Set - "Transaction Failure Risk Assessment"

New Philosophy: Every question should either:
- Quantify actual losses happening RIGHT NOW
- Expose a blind spot they didn't know they had
- Make them realize "oh shit, we can't actually do that"

================================================================================
Section 1: Company Profile (Non-Scoring)
================================================================================

- Brokerage Name (text)
- Number of Agents (1-10, 11-25, 26-50, 51-100, 100+)
- Average Monthly Transactions (1-10, 11-20, 21-50, 51-100, 101-200, 200+)
- Primary Market/City (text)
- What transaction management system do you use? (SkySlope, LoneWolf, Dotloop, Other, None)

This helps tailor the follow-up pitch.

================================================================================
Section 2: Deal Failure Reality (Max 45 pts)
================================================================================

Q1: In the last 12 months, how many deals fell through AFTER being under contract?
- We don't track this (0 pts - worst answer)
- 0 deals (5 pts - tiny brokerage or lying)
- 1-3 deals (20 pts - honest)
- 4-8 deals (15 pts)
- 9-15 deals (10 pts)
- 15+ deals (5 pts)

Q2: Of those failed deals, what percentage were due to missed deadlines, inspection issues, or document problems?
- Don't know/Can't say (0 pts - you don't track = you don't learn)
- Less than 25% (20 pts)
- 25-50% (15 pts - industry average is 15-20% deadline-related)
- 50-75% (10 pts - serious problem)
- 75-100% (5 pts - crisis)

Q3: Based on your average commission per deal, what's the approximate dollar value of lost commissions from failed deals in the last 12 months?
- Haven't calculated (0 pts - "what you don't measure, you don't manage")
- Under $50K (25 pts)
- $50K-$150K (20 pts)
- $150K-$300K (15 pts)
- $300K-$500K (10 pts)
- Over $500K (5 pts)

Scoring Insight: This section establishes baseline pain. If they score low here, the rest of the assessment shows them WHY.

================================================================================
Section 3: Deadline Visibility Gap (Max 100 pts)
================================================================================

Q4: Right now, without looking anything up, how many of your agents have inspection deadlines in the next 7 days?
- Can tell you the exact number (35 pts - they have real-time visibility)
- Could find out in under 5 minutes (25 pts - have a system but not automated)
- Would need to ask TCs or agents (15 pts - no central visibility)

- We don't proactively check this (0 pts)

Q9: When HOA documents contradict something in the purchase agreement (e.g., rental restrictions), how do you catch it?
- AI cross-references all transaction documents automatically (35 pts)
- TC manually reviews for conflicts (20 pts)
- Hoping agent notices during their review (10 pts)
- Usually only catch it if client asks or title finds it (5 pts)

Scoring Insight: Final gut-punch on whether they're protected or exposed.

================================================================================
Revised Scoring Framework (Total 512 points)
================================================================================

500-512 points (88%+): Transaction Intelligence Leader
You're operating at the highest level. You have visibility, automation, and proactive systems that prevent failures before they happen. Your risk exposure is minimal.

400-499 points (71-87%): Moderate Risk with Gaps
You have some good systems, but significant blind spots exist. You're probably losing $75-150K annually to preventable failures. Your manual processes are creating bottlenecks and risk.

300-399 points (53-70%): High Risk - Flying Blind
Major visibility gaps. You don't know what you don't know. You're likely losing $150-300K+ annually and operating reactively rather than proactively. One bad quarter could be catastrophic.

200-299 points (35-52%): Critical Risk
Your brokerage is in danger. Deal failures are common, agent inconsistency is rampant, and you have little oversight until problems explode. Immediate intervention needed.

Under 200 points (<35%): Existential Threat
You are one major E&O claim away from serious financial consequences. The lack of transaction intelligence and deadline management puts every single deal at risk.
